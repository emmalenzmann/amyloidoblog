title: Amyloidoblog
---

Hi there! I'm Emma, a postbac researcher at NIH (I, of course, do not speak on their behalf). My research surrounds a chaperone protein and how it deals with amyloids. Amyloids are misfolded proteins that are implicated in various diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. This blog will be used to document my journey and also to show how I learn and think about the field of amyloid diseases. {style="text-align: justify;"}
